# Predicting Flight Ticket Prices Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Brief explanation of the project.

## Project Vision and Goal
What you aimed to build.

## Data Source
What data you used (Amadeus API).

## Architecture
- ETL Pipeline (Extraction → Transformation → Loading)
- Storage (Azure Data Lake, Delta Lake, SQL Server)

## Machine Learning Approach
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (RandomForestRegressor, etc.)

## Application Workflow
- Frontend: Flask + HTML
- Backend: ML models (.pkl files)
- Output: Deal prediction and price forecasting

## Key Features
- Predicts future flight prices.
- Shows if a current ticket price is a "Good Deal."
- Visualizes price forecasts.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas)
- Azure (Data Factory, Databricks, Data Lake)
- SQL Server
- Power BI
- Matplotlib

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
4. Open `localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Folder Structure
- `/data` — contains sample flight price data
- `/models` — contains trained `.pkl` ML models
- `/templates` — HTML files
- `/app.py` — main Flask application

## Screenshots
(Add some screenshots from your Flask app or prediction graphs.)
